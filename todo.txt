* improve docs for getting started

* Update a patch table in an existing status report in twiki

* Gather stats on patch submissions from mailing list archives

* For kernel patches, perhaps track patches as they proceed through
  the appropriate subsystem maintainer trees, etc.

* Perhaps differentiate between patches which were specifically NAK'd
  from ones that are still pending (or that fell through the cracks).
  The latter may be worth following up on.

* Tally counts of patches from @.*samsung.com in general, as well as
  specifically by OSG team members.  Track Samsung and OSG's rankings
  for patch contributions on a yearly and all-time basis.

* commit-stats should provide a configurable table of email aliases and
  hiring times for SRA/SRUK members.  The LF annual report does this
  with a rewrite hash table.  The emails can be found in the username
  column at http://osg.sisa.samsung.com/bin/view/OpenSourceGroup/SRA-SVOss
